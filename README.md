 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Coding Journey</h3></summary>
I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world. In 2018, I embarked on a journey that would forever change my life. I entered college with a burning passion for computers and everything involving technology. I was always fascinated by the idea of creating innovative solutions that could solve problems efficiently. During my college years, I dove deeply into the world of programming. Every line of code I wrote, every problem I solved, fueled my passion. I learned not just the language of computers, but also the art of thinking logically and solving problems efficiently.
<br/>
In 2021, I completed my undergraduate degree. It was a moment of pride and accomplishment, but also the beginning of a new chapter. I entered the job market, ready to apply everything I had learned. It was challenging and sometimes overwhelming, but each challenge only reinforced my passion for programming. In the same year, I decided to take my education a step further. I enrolled in a master's program in computer engineering, specializing in mobile computing. I was eager to explore this emerging and exciting field.
<br/>
Today, I look back at my journey and feel immense gratitude. Programming is not just a skill, it's a passion, a vocation. I'm excited to see where this journey will take me next.
